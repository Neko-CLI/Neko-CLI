**Neko CLI** is a whimsical command-line utility that lets you manage your npm and yarn packages with ease and fun, embodying the charming essence of a cat ('neko' in Japanese). With Neko CLI, you can add or remove packages, initialize projects, and more, all through a delightful user interface.


🐾 **deps.neko** - The Native Package Manager of Neko CLI

`deps.neko` is the beating heart of **Neko CLI**, a lock file that tracks packages and their versions for each project managed. It functions as a dedicated dependency manager, much like `package.json` in npm, but with a fun feline twist. Every package added via Neko CLI is recorded in `deps.neko`, allowing you to easily manage your project's dependencies.

The `deps.neko` file contains detailed information about the packages, including version, integrity, and dependency type (runtime or dev), providing a more organized and enjoyable experience for managing packages. With `deps.neko`, you'll always have full control over your dependencies in a simple and intuitive way!

This addition should give your users a clear understanding of how `deps.neko` works within Neko CLI.
